Act as a Senior Symfony Developer and Technical Writer for Medium.com. I want you to write a high-quality technical article about my new Symfony bundle called "PGI" (Progressive Image Bundle).

CONTEXT:
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/tito10047/progressive-image-bundle
Real usercase https://6slov.sk/
page insight https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-6slov-sk/4xox54ij9d

GOAL:
Write an engaging, professional, and slightly opinionated article that showcases why PGI is the ultimate solution for image handling in modern Symfony applications.

CORE PROBLEMS WE SOLVE:
1. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Explain how images without defined dimensions hurt SEO and UX.
2. Developer Experience (DX): The struggle with complex responsive image syntax.
3. automatic image resizing for diferents layouts and ortientations

KEY FEATURES TO HIGHLIGHT:
- The "PGI" Branding: Modern, fast, and stable.
- The Syntax: Showcase the intuitive "md:6@landscape" and arbitrary value "[430x370]" support.
- Zero CLS: Using CSS variables and aspect-ratio automatically.
- Point of Interest (PoI): Smart cropping that focuses on what matters.
- Symfony UX Integration: Twig Components and Stimulus reveal effects.

ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
1. Catchy Title: Something like "Solving the Image Problem in Symfony: Meet PGI" or "Zero CLS and High Performance: The New Standard for Symfony Images."
2. The Hook: Why Core Web Vitals changed everything for web developers.
3. The "Aha!" Moment: Introducing PGI and its unique approach to metadata (PHP Streams).
4. Code Showcases: Comparison between standard image handling and PGI's Twig component.
5. Technical Deep Dive: Briefly explain the CSS variable magic and responsive strategies.
6. Conclusion: Why this belongs in every Symfony 6.4/7.x project.

TONE:
Professional, authoritative, but accessible. Use clear headings, bullet points, and high-quality code snippets. The article should feel like a "must-read" for the Symfony community.

Please analyze the GitHub README and code to ensure technical accuracy.
